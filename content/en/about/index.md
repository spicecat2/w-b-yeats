Welcome to the official website of William Butler Yeats (1865-1939), one of the greatest poets in the English language.  
William Butler Yeats was born in Dublin, Ireland and is widely considered to be one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature. He was a major driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival, a movement that sought to promote Irish culture and literature in the face of British colonial rule. His writing style was heavily influenced by his Irish heritage and his love for Irish folklore. He often wrote about themes such as love, death, religion, and politics.  
Yeats' poetry is known for its use of symbolism, imagery, and allusions to mythology. His works often explored the tension between the spiritual realm and the physical world, as well as the power of nature. He also wrote extensively on Irish nationalism and the struggle for independence from Britain.  
Yeats won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin and was made a member of the Order of Merit by King George V. He was also posthumously awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1939.  
I have personally found Yeats' work to be incredibly inspiring and thought-provoking. His poems are filled with beautiful imagery and symbolism that speaks to the human experience. I am particularly drawn to his exploration of Irish identity and his use of language to evoke emotion. I believe that Yeats' legacy will continue to live on through his timeless works.
