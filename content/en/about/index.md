William Butler Yeats (1865–1939) was an Irish poet and playwright. He was educated between Dublin and London, studying poetry.

Yeats was heavily influenced by the Celtic Revival, a movement against English cultural influences in Ireland, drawing extensively from Irish mythology and folklore. His poetry grew more politicized and pessimistic through the increasingly intense Irish political landscape. Yeats also had a life-long interest in mysticism and occultism, forming the basis for much of his late poetry. Throughout his works, Yeats used allusions and symbols to suggest more abstract and powerful thoughts, and always maintained strict traditional verse forms.

Yeats’ early Irish works have received criticism for being overly ornate, and his later mystical poems were criticized for lacking in intellectual credibility, while other poets such as Seamus Heaney have commended Yeats for continually refining his poetic craftsmanship. Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th century.
